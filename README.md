In-Depth Visual Design

Visual design is a very important part of a website. An attractive layout can increase usability and create more engagement. There are two sets of important things to think about in visual design. 

The first is the elements of design. These include line, shape, negative space, volume, value, color and texture. These are the most basic things visual designers must have a very good understanding of. Lines are important because they create shapes, patterns and textures. They can use different properties to portray a clearer message. Lines can create connections between elements. Next is shape, and shapes have lengths and widths. Shapes are used for effective communication because they are easily recognizable. Next is negative space, also known as white space, which is the empty area around a shape. Another name for the relationship between space and shape is figure/ground, where ground is the area around the figure. Every time a designer makes a shape, they must be aware they are also creating negative spaces. Negative space is used to create interesting and creative visual effects. Next is volume, which is similar to shape except they have length, width and depth. Volume is used to create 3d visual designs which is less common than 2d. Next is value, which compares light and dark. Contrast of values is a good tool to make something clearer. At the same time, values can be used to make something less prominent by use of subtlety. Next is color, which is usage of light. Color is important to design because they convey emotions, add a sense of separation from competition, add interest and variety and create different areas of a page. Last is texture, which is the surface quality of an object. Texture is important to design because it adds a sense of feeling to your design. It can make something on a 2d screen feel like an actual button to make users more comfortable clicking on it. 

The second set is the Principles of design. These inform us how the elements above go together. These include scale, visual hierarchy, balance, contrast, and gestalt. Scale is used very commonly to show importance by using relative size. Something bigger is more likely to be noticed than something smaller. Visual hierarchy is used to guide the userâ€™s eye to certain areas of the page based on their importance. It is very important for the layout because it controls the delivery of the experience. Balance is the arrangement or proportion of design elements. It is important because it can create different types of organization for the reader. Contrast is used to create a sense of difference within your design. Distinction is important because makes certain parts stand out to users. Gestalt is how humans look at something and put it together in their minds. It is sometimes important on how different things can come together and be looked at as a whole.
